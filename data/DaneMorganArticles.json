A spectral weight approach to band unfolding has been applied as a means of distinguishing the indirect and direct band gaps from folded supercell band structures. In this way, four characteristic regions of the band gap character have been identified for Ge 1\u2212 x Sn x alloy: an indirect band gap (x< 6.5%), a direct band gap (6.5%< x< 25%) and an inverse band gap (x> 25%) with inverse spin\u2013orbit split-off for 45%< x< 85%. In general, it has been observed that the bowing parameters of band edges (\u0393 and L-point in conduction band (CB \u0393 and CB L), valence band (VB), and spin\u2013orbit (SO) band) are rather large (= 2.43\u00b10.06 eV, = 0.64\u00b10.04 eV, =\u2212 0.59\u00b10.04\u00a0\u2026",

In order to interpret optical transitions observed in CER, PR, and PzR spectra, the electronic band structure for the four crystals has been calculated from the first principles within the density functional theory for various points of Brillouin zone including K and H points. It is clearly shown that the electronic band structure at H point of Brillouin zone is very symmetric and similar to the electronic band structure at K point, and therefore, direct optical transitions at H point should be expected in modulated reflectance spectra besides the direct optical transitions at the K point of Brillouin zone. This prediction is confirmed by experimental studies of the electronic band structure of MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2 crystals by\u00a0\u2026",

Obtained results have been interpreted in the context of ab initio electronic band structure calculations in which the supercell (SC) based calculations are joined with the alchemical mixing (AM) approximation applied to a single atom in the cell. This approach, which we call SC-AM, allows on the one hand to study alloys with a very small Bi content, and on the other hand to avoid limitations characteristic of a pure AM approximation. It has been shown that the pure AM does not reproduce the GaSb 1\u2212 x Bi x band gap determined from PR while the agreement between experimental data and the ab initio calculations of the band gap obtained within the SC-AM approach is excellent. These calculations show that the incorporation of Bi atoms into the GaSb host modifies both the conduction and the valence band\u00a0\u2026",

In this work, we use all three approaches together to fabricate direct-band-gap Ge\u2212 Sn alloys. The heavily doped n-type Ge\u2212 Sn is realized with CMOS-compatible nonequilibrium material processing. P is used to form highly doped n-type Ge\u2212 Sn layers and to modify the lattice parameter of P-doped Ge\u2212 Sn alloys. The strain engineering in heavily-P-doped Ge\u2212 Sn films is confirmed by x-ray diffraction and micro Raman spectroscopy. The change of the band gap in P-doped Ge\u2212 Sn alloy as a function of P concentration is theoretically predicted by density functional theory and experimentally verified by near-infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry. According to the shift of the absorption edge, it is shown that for an electron concentration greater than 1\u00d7 10 cm the band-gap renormalization is partially\u00a0\u2026",

      "Description": "Multipactor breakdown (MPB) is a RF breakdown phenomenon that decreases the overall efficiency of high power RF systems operating in vacuum. In worst case scenario, MPB might also lead to complete failure of the device. Among other factors, secondary electron emission (SEE) from device electrodes in synchronism with E-field oscillations forms the important basis for triggering MPB. Therefore, minimizing SEE is important in improving RF vacuum device performance. This presentation will show the results of secondary electron yield (SEY) measurements in the low energy regime (10 eV to 1000 eV) for the materials of interest to space electronic system, including copper, aluminum 6061 and silver. In addition, different surface treatment methods adopted in this study to suppress SEY will be shown. Furthermore, simulations of copper SEY will be presented.

It is shown that incorporation of a few percent of N atoms has a drastic effect on the electronic structure of the alloys. The change of the electronic band structure is very well described by the band anticrossing (BAC) model in which localized nitrogen states interact with the extended states of the conduction band of GaAsP host. The BAC interaction results in the formation of a narrow intermediate band (E\u2212 band in BAC model) with the minimum at the \u0393 point of the Brillouin zone resulting in a change of the nature of the fundamental band gap from indirect to direct. The splitting of the conduction band by the BAC interaction is further confirmed by a direct observation of the optical\u00a0\u2026",

Here, we report on the fabrication of GeSn alloys with Sn concentrations up to 4.5% using ion implantation followed by millisecond-range explosive solid phase epitaxy. The n-type single crystalline GeSn alloys are realized by coimplantation of Sn and P into Ge. Both the activation of P and the formation of GeSn are performed during a single-step flash lamp annealing for 3 ms. The bandgap engineering in GeSn as a function of the doping level and Sn concentration is theoretically predicted by density functional theory and experimentally verified using ellipsometric spectroscopy. We demonstrate that both the diffusion and the segregation of Sn and P atoms in Ge are fully suppressed by millisecond-range nonequilibrium thermal processing.",

Two approaches have been examined: the virtual crystal approximation (VCA) and the supercell-based calculations (SC). The composition dependence of the lattice parameter obtained from the SC obeys Vegard\u2019s law whereas the volume optimization in the VCA leads to an anomalous bowing of the lattice constant. A strong correlation between the band-gaps and the structural parameter in the VCA method has been observed. On the other hand, in the SC method the supercell size and atoms arrangement (clustered vs. uniform) appear to have a great influence on the computed band-gaps.

The calculated band-gap dependence on Tl content in this hypothetical alloy exhibits a linear behavior up to the 25% of thallium content where its value approaches zero. In turn, the split-off energy at the \u0393 point of the Brillouin zone, related to the spin-orbit coupling, is predicted to be comparable in value to the band-gap for relatively low thallium content of about 5%. These findings point to Tl x In 1\u2212 x N alloy as a promising material for optoelectronic applications.

      "Description": "There has been a growing effort to replace hand extraction of data from research papers with automated data extraction based on natural language processing (NLP), language models (LMs), and recently, large language models (LLMs). Although these methods enable efficient extraction of data from large sets of research papers, they require a significant amount of up-front effort, expertise, and coding. In this work we propose the ChatExtract method that can fully automate very accurate data extraction with essentially no initial effort or background using an advanced conversational LLM (or AI). ChatExtract consists of a set of engineered prompts applied to a conversational LLM that both identify sentences with data, extract data, and assure its correctness through a series of follow-up questions. These follow-up questions address a critical challenge associated with LLMs - their tendency to provide factually inaccurate responses. ChatExtract can be applied with any conversational LLMs and yields very high quality data extraction. In tests on materials data we find precision and recall both over 90% from the best conversational LLMs, likely rivaling or exceeding human accuracy in many cases. We demonstrate that the exceptional performance is enabled by the information retention in a conversational model combined with purposeful redundancy and introducing uncertainty through follow-up prompts. These results suggest that approaches similar to ChatExtract, due to their simplicity, transferability and accuracy are likely to replace other methods of data extraction in the near future.",

The method is fully automated except for one human-assisted step, which typically requires just a few hours of human labor. The method builds on top of natural language processing and large general language models but can work with almost any such model. The language models GPT-3/3.5, bart and DeBERTaV3 are evaluated here for comparison. We provide a detailed detailed analysis of the methods performance in extracting bulk modulus data, obtaining up to 90% precision at 96% recall, depending on the amount of human effort involved.

      "Description": "Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), especially in two-dimensional (2D) form, exhibit many properties desirable for device applications. However, device performance can be hindered by the presence of defects. Here, we combine state of the art experimental and computational approaches to determine formation energies and charge transition levels of defects in bulk and 2D MX2 (M\u2009=\u2009Mo or W; X\u2009=\u2009S, Se, or Te). We perform deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) measurements of bulk TMDs. Simultaneously, we calculate formation energies and defect levels of all native point defects, which enable identification of levels observed in DLTS and extend our calculations to vacancies in 2D TMDs, for which DLTS is challenging. We find that reduction of dimensionality of TMDs to 2D has a significant impact on defect properties. This finding may explain differences in optical properties of 2D TMDs synthesized\u00a0\u2026",

However, due to their complexity and high computational costs, simplified but reliable models are of great value. In this work, we present an original method of finding the 30-band k\u00b7 p parameters on an example of Ge 1-x Sn x alloy. It allows to reproduce the electronic band structure in the full BZ and in the full composition range. The method uses the state-of-the-art supercell based ab initio calculations as the reference. A direct fitting of the k\u00b7 p parameters from ab initio supercell band structures is difficult since the assignment of the k\u00b7 p bands to correct eigenvalues of the reference band structures may be ambiguous. For this reason, the ab initio computational alchemy is used as an intermediate step. Owing to its properties, the supercell unfolded eigenvalues are approximated with continuous curves, which enables a straigthforward way to\u00a0\u2026",

Performances of the finite difference (FD) method and the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) are tested and compared. Both of these methods are applied to two different approaches of alloy simulation, a supercell of 16 and 32 atoms (for zinc-blende and wurtzite structures, resp.) and the alchemical mixing (AM) method, where the pseudopotentials are mixed in an appropriate way to form an alloy. All elastic properties, including the elastic tensors, elastic moduli, Poisson\u2019s ratio, B/G, and relaxation coefficient, as well as lattice parameters are calculated using all said methods. Conclusions about the use of the approaches investigated in this paper and about their performance are drawn. In addition, in both crystal structures, the band gap is studied in the whole composition range using the MBJLDA functional. The band gap bowings are unusually high, which confirms earlier reports.",

Other group IV alloys may also potentially exhibit material properties useful for device applications, expanding the space for band gap engineering in group IV. In this work the electronic band structure of all group IV semiconductor alloys is investigated. Twelve possible A: B alloys, where A is a semiconducting host (A= C, Si, and Ge) and B is an isovalent dopant (B= C, Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb), were studied in the dilute regime (0.8%) of the isovalent dopant in the entire Brillouin zone (BZ), and the chemical trends in the evolution of their electronic band structure were carefully analyzed.

In contrast, the pressure response of a low-temperature orthorhombic phase (OP) of MAPbI3 has not been explored and understood. In this research, we investigate for the first time how hydrostatic pressure alters the electronic landscape of the OP of MAPbI3. Pressure studies using photoluminescence combined with calculations within density functional theory at zero temperature allowed us to identify the main physical factors affecting the bandgap evolution of the OP of MAPbI3. The negative bandgap pressure coefficient was found to be strongly dependent on the temperature (\u03b1120K = \u221213.3 \u00b1 0.1 meV/GPa, \u03b180K = \u221229.8 \u00b1 0.1 meV/GPa, and \u03b140K = \u221236.3 \u00b1 0.1 meV/GPa).
